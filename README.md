<p align="center"> My name is Jean de Dieu. I also go by JD if there are too many other Jean around. I've been writing software for a while and have spent a good time in the dev tool   space. I think a ton about how us developers do our jobs and how we can improve our tools to make better software quicker. I hate how difficult software is to learnâ€”particularly for new engineers. If I'm able to do anything in my career well, I hope that it's making things a little easier for the people that are new here. </p>
